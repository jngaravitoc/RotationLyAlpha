1. Direccional:

In this notebook the observer viewing angles analysis is made.
In cell 6 plots are made, this plots are Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of the paper.
In the last cell (Cell 8) que Escape Fraction is calculated.
This notebook 

2. Off-Center Sphere:

In this notebook all the analysis of the Off center model is made.
Cell 6 of this notebook makes Fig. 11 of the paper. (Figures of the spectra for the off center model)

3. Integrated Flux.:

This notebook makes the analysis for section 3.5 and the figure of this section, Fig 12
with the Narrow Band Filter.

4. Integrated Flux Dusty:

This notebook makes the same thing as Integrated Flux but for dusty models. 

5. Maximums Position:

In this notebook is made the plots of the maxima position vs V_{max} (Fig. 4)
In cell 2 the plot is made.
The data used in this notebook has been obtained by eye inspection.

6. Nscatt:

In this notebook the plot of Nscatt vs Vmax is made, Fig. 5 of the paper.
The data comes from the original data column [:,7] Python notation.

7. TempHistogram_Nscatt:

In this notebook the 2D histograms Of Nscatt vs V are made Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.


8. Width_Analysis

In this notebook the plot W1/2 vs V_{max} is made in cell 2. This plot 
corresponds to Fig. 3 of the paper.

9. escpae_fraction:

In this notebook the escape fraction in ploted:
In cell 7 fesc Vs V_{max} Fig. 8 of the paper
In cell 9 the comparison with the Neufeld Analytical Solution. Fig. 9 of the paper

data used in this paper comes from the last cell of the direccional notebook.
