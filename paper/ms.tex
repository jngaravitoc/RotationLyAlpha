\begin{abstract}

We present results of radiative transfer calculations to measure the
impact of gas bulk rotation on the morphology of the Lyman $\alpha$
emission line in distant galaxies. We model a galaxy as a sphere with
a homogeneous mixture of dust and hydrogen at a constant
temperature. These spheres have a solid-body rotation with maximum
velocities in the range $0-300$ \kms and neutral hydrogen optical
depths in the range $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{5}-10^{7}$. We consider cases 
of a single central \lya source, and a uniform distribution of sources. 
Our main finding are that the escape fraction of \lya photons, and
the intensity at the line center increases with rotational velocity. 
For homogeneously distributed sources the line becomes single peaked 
at rotational velocities larger than half the line width in the static case.
For radiation sources located off-center, the line morphology presents 
a range of single, double and triple peaks. We show how these results 
are useful to interpret recent spectroscopic results of distant 
$z\sim 2-3$ star forming galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The detection of strong \ly emission lines has become an essential
method in extra-galactic astronomy to find distant star-forming
galaxies
\citep{PartridgePeebles,Rhoads00,Gawiser2007,Koehler2007,Ouchi08,Yamada2012,Schenker2012,Finkelstein2013}.
The galaxies detected using this method receive the 
name of \ly emitters (LAEs). A detailed examination of this galaxy
population has diverse implications for galaxy formation, reionization
and the large scale structure of the Universe. Attempts to fully
exploit the physical information included in the \ly line require an
understanding of all the physical factors involved in shaping the
line. Due to the resonant nature of this line, these physical factors
notably include temperature, density and bulk velocity field of the neutral
Hydrogen in the emitting galaxy and its surroundings.


A basic understanding of the quantitative behavior of the \ly line
has been reached through analytic studies in the case of a static
configurations, such as uniform slabs
\citep{Adams72,Harrington73,Neufeld90} and uniform spheres
\citep{Dijkstra06}. Analytic studies of configurations including
some kind of bulk flow only include the case of a sphere with a Hubble
like expansion flow \citep{LoebRybicki}. 

A quantitative description of the \ly line has been reached through
Monte Carlo simulations \citep{Auer68,Avery68,Adams72}. In the last
two decades these studies have become popular due to the
availability of computing power. Early into the 21st century, the first
studies focused on homogeneous and static media
\citep{Ahn00,Ahn01,Zheng02}; Later on, the effects of clumpy media
\citep{Hansen06} and expanding/contracting shell/spherical geometries started to
be studied \citep{Verhamme06,Dijkstra06,Ahn2014}. Similar codes have applied
these results to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation \citep{Orsi12, GAREL2012} and
results of large hydrodynamic simulations
\citep{CLARA,Forero12,Behrens13}. Recently, Monte Carlo codes have also
been applied to the results of high resolution hydrodynamic
simulations of individual
galaxies\citep{Laursen09,Barnes11,Verhamme12,Yajima12}. Meanwhile, recent
developments have been focused on the systematic study of clumpy
outflows \citep{DijkstraKramer}and anisotropic velocity configurations
\citep{Zheng2013}. 

The recent studies of galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations
\citep{Laursen09,Barnes11,Verhamme12,Yajima12} have all shown
systematic variations in the \ly line with the viewing angle. These
variations are a complex superposition of anisotropic density
configurations (i.e. edge-on vs. face-on view of a galaxy), the
inflows observed by gas cooling and the outflows included in the
supernova feedback process of the simulation. These bulk flows
physically correspond to the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium
(CGM and IGM). These effects are starting to be studied
 in simplified configurations that vary the density and wind
 characteristics \citep{Zheng2013,BEHRENS2014}. 

However, in all these efforts the effect of rotation,
which is an ubiquitous feature in galaxies, has not been
systematically studied. The processing of the \ly photons in a
rotating interstellar medium (ISM) must have some kind of impact in
the \ly line morphology. 

Performing that study is the main goal of this paper. We investigate for the
first time the impact of rotation on the morphology of the \ly
line. We focus on a simplified system: a spherical gas cloud with
homogeneous density and solid body rotation, to study the line
morphology and the escape fraction in the presence of dust. We base
our work on two independent Monte Carlo based radiative transfer codes
presented in \cite{CLARA} and \cite{DijkstraKramer}.   
  
This paper is structured as follows: In \S \ref{sec:implementation} we
present the implementation of bulk rotation into the Monte Carlo
codes, paying special attention to coordinate definitions. We also
present a short review of how the \ly radiative transfer codes work
and list the different physical parameters in the simulated grid of
models. In \S \ref{sec:results} we present the results of the
simulations, with special detail to quantities that show a
clear evolution as a function of the sphere rotational velocity. In \S
\ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the implications of our results in the
interpretation of LAEs observations with high resolution
spectroscoy. In the last section we present our conclusions.    


In this paper we express a photon's frequency in terms of the
dimensionless variable $x\equiv (\nu -\nu_a)/\Delta\nu_\alpha$, where
$\nu_{\alpha}=2.46\times 10^{15}$ Hz is the Ly$\alpha$ resonance
frequency,  $\Delta\nu_{\alpha} \equiv
\nu_{\alpha}\sqrt{2kT/m_pc^2}\equiv \nu_av_{\rm th}/c $ is the Doppler
broadening of the line which depends on the neutral gas temperature
$T$ scattering the radiation or equivalently the thermal velocity
$v_{\rm th}$ of the atoms.  For the temperature $T=10^4$K used in our
radiative transfer calculations the thermal velocity is
$v_{th}=12.8$\kms.  




\section{Models of bulk gas rotation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Describing the kinematics of gas rotation in all generality is a
complex task, specially at high redshift where there is still missing
a thorough observational account of rotation in galaxies beyond
$z>1.0$. Even at low redshifts there is a great
variation in the shape of the rotation curve as observed in HI
emission as a function of the distance to the galaxy center. However
there are two recurrent features. First, in the
central galactic region the velocity increases proportional to the radius,
following a solid rotation behavior. Second, beyond a certain radius
the rotation curve tends to flatten.  An ab-initio description of
such realistic rotation curves in simulations depends on having access to
the dynamic evolution of all mass components in the galaxy: stars, gas
and dark matter. Such level of realism is extremely complex to
achieve, specially if one wants to get a systematic description based
on statistics of simulated objects. 

Following the tradition of studies of \ly emitting systems,
we implement a model with simplified geometry. We assume that the gas
is homogeneously distributed in a sphere that rotates as a solid body
with constant angular velocity. This simple model will contain only
one free parameter: the linear velocity at the sphere's surface, $V_{\rm
  max}$. 

\subsection{Detailed Implementation of Rotation}

 In the Monte Carlo code we define a Cartesian coordinate system to
 describe the position of each photon. The origin of this system
 coincides with the center of the sphere and the rotation axis is defined
 to be $z$-axis. With this choice, the components of the gas bulk velocity
 field, $\vec{v} = v_{x}\hat{i} + v_{y}\hat{j} + v_{z}\hat{k}$, can be
 written as  
  
\begin{equation}
    v_{x}=-\frac{y}{R}V_{\rm max}, \label{subeq1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    v_{y}=\frac{x}{R}V_{\rm max}, \label{subeq2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    v_{z}=0, \label{subeq3}
\end{equation}
%
where $R$ is the radius of the sphere and $V_{\rm max}$ is the linear
velocity at the sphere's surface. The minus/plus sign in the
$x$/$y$-component of the velocity indicates the direction of
rotation. In this case we take the angular velocity in the same
direction as the $\hat{k}$ unit vector. With these definitions we can
write the angular velocity as $\omega=V_{\rm max}/R$.  

For each photon in the simulation we have its initial position inside
the sphere, direction of propagation $\hat{k}_{in}$ and reduced
frequency $x_{in}$. The photon's propagation stops once they cross the
surface of the sphere. At this point we store the position, the outgoing direction
of propagation $\hat{k}_{out}$ and the reduced frequency $x_{out}$. We
define the angle $\Theta$ by $\cos\Theta = \hat{k}_{\rm obs}\cdot
\hat{k}_{\rm out}$, that is the angle of the outgoing photon with
respect to the directions towards the observer. Following
\cite{Zheng2013} we make the study of the anisotropic emission in
terms of this angle. 


\subsection{Brief Description of the Radiative Transfer Codes}

Here we briefly describe the relevant points for the two radiative
transfer codes we have used. For a detailed description we refer the
reader to the original papers \cite{CLARA,DijkstraKramer}.

The codes follow the individual scatterings of \ly photons as they
travel through a 3D distribution of neutral Hydrogen. At each
scattering the frequency of the photon (in the laboratory frame) and
its direction of propagation change. This change in frequency is due
to the peculiar velocities of the Hydrogen atom that absorbed and
re-emitted the photon. If dust is present, the photon can interact
either with a Hydrogen atom or dust grain. In the case of a dust
interaction the photon can be either absorbed or scattered, this
probability is encoded in the dust albedo, $A$, which we chose to be
$1/2$. In order to obtain accurate values for the escape fraction of
photons in the presence of dust, we do not use any accelerating
mechanism in the radiative transfer. Once the photons escape the gas
distribution we store their direction at their direction of
propagation and frequency at their last scattering.

The photons are thus emitted in some region of the gas distribution
and follow a random walk in space and frequency until they escape the
gas distribution or are absorbed by a dust grain. The initialization
process for the \ly photons has to specify its position, frequency and
direction of propagation. In our case we select the initial frequency
to be exactly the \ly rest-frame frequency ($x=0$) and the direction of
propagation to be random following an flat probability distribution
over the sphere.


The gas is completely defined by its geometry (i.e. sphere or slab),
temperature $T$, Hydrogen optical depth $\tau_{\rm H}$, dust optical
depth $\tau_{\rm a}$ and the bulk velocity field $\vec{v}$. Our codes
treat the gas as homogeneous in density ($\tau_{\rm H}$, $\tau_{\rm
  a}$) and temperature.

	over all directions, this means we made histograms of the 
	numbers of photons escaping the galaxy with a given frequency.
    \label{fig:differentvelocities}}  
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Grid of Simulated Galaxies}
\label{sec:models}

In the Monte Carlo calculations we follow the propagation of $N_{\gamma}=10^5$
numerical photons through different spherical galaxies. For each galaxy
we vary at least one of the following parameters: the maximum
rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$, the hydrogen optical depth $\tau_{H}$,
the dust optical depth $\tau_{a}$ and the initial distribution of photons
with respect to the gas. There are $60$ models initial combining all
variations of the input parameters. Table \ref{table:models}
summarizes the different parameters.

Additionally, we have used two independently developed Monte Carlo
codes \citep{CLARA,DijkstraKramer} to perform the calculations of the
non-dusty models. The results we report are robust in the sense
that they are obtained by both codes. 

\begin{table}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The central result of this paper is summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:differentvelocities}. It shows the clear
impact of rotation on the morphology of the emergent \ly line,
This profiles were obtained integrating the flux of photons 
 over all directions, this means we made histograms of the 
 numbers of photons escaping the galaxy with a given frequency
The panel focus on the results for all of our symmetric models
 $\tau_{H}=(10^{5}, 10^{6}, 10^{7}$), showing that the
influence of rotation is present both when the photons are either
homogeneously or centrally initialized over the gas volume.  

In the next subsections we characterize the line morphology by the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the location of the peak
maxima. In order to interpret the morphological changes in the line we
also report the median number of scatter for each \ly photon in the
simulation. For the models where dust is included we measure the 
escape fraction as a function of rotational velocity. Finally, we make
an estimate of the impact of anisotropic emission.



\subsection{Line width and peak maxima}
\label{sec:widthpeak}

  \caption{FWHM for the non-dusty models as a function of

    results in velocity units while the right panel normalizes
    the data by the FWHM in the static case. 
    Continuous (dashed) lines  correspond to central (homogeneous)
    source distributions. The straight lines represent the fit to
    the data using the expression in Eq. (\ref{eq:fwhm}).
    \label{fig:widthvsvelocity}} 
\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{f3.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Position of the peak maxima as a function of rotational
  velocity $V_{\rm max}$. Continuous (dashed) lines correspond to
  central (homogeneous) source distributions. A value of $x_{\rm
    max}=0$ indicates that line becomes single
  peaked. \label{fig:maximumsvsvelocity}}  
\end{figure}

There are three clear effects on the line's morphology as the
rotational velocity increases. First, the line
broadens; second, the double peaks reduce their intensity; and third,
the intensity at the line center rises. The last two effects merge to give the
impression that the double peaks are merger into one at high rotational
velocities, a result that is evident for the homogeneously distributed
sources as shown in the dashed lines of Figure \ref{fig:differentvelocities}.

We use the full width at half maximum (FWHM) to quantify the line
broadening. For this we measure the width by finding
the closest points to the half maximum in our histogram numerically. 
 Figure \ref{fig:widthvsvelocity} shows how the FWHM increases
with rotational velocity both for the central an homogeneous source
distributions.  We parametrize the dependency of the line width with
$V_{\rm max}$ as
\begin{equation}
 {\rm FWHM}^2 = {\rm FWHM}_{0}^2 + V_{\rm max}^2/\lambda^2,
\label{eq:fwhm}
\end{equation}
%
where FWHM$_{0}$ is the
velocity width in the static case and $\lambda$ is a positive scalar
to be determined as a fit to the data. With this test we want to know
to what extent the new velocity width can be expressed as a quadratic
sum of the two relevant velocities in the problem. We fit
simultaneously all the points corresponding to central and homogeneous
models to find $\lambda_{\rm c} = 3.89 \pm 0.04$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}=
1.98\pm 0.06$ respectively. 

In order to quantify the transition to a single peak we measure the
position for the peak maxima as a function of the rotational
velocity. Our results are presented in Figure
\ref{fig:maximumsvsvelocity} where it is clear that for central
sources there are two peaks with fixed positions as the rotational
velocity changes, with the only exception of the model with $\tau_{\rm
  H}=10^6$ and $V_{\rm max}=300$\kms. However, in the case of
homogeneously emitted sources the maxima position remain fixed until
some velocity threshold is reachd and the line becomes single peaked
with $x_{\rm m}=0$. By inspection we find that in all cases the
transition has occurred when the rotational velocity is larger than
half the FWHM. 

One possible explanation for the emergence of the single peak in the
homogeneous systems is that some photons close to the surface
(a sort of photosphere) can escape with a low number of scatterings,
allowing them to stay close to the line's center. Increasing the
rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$ reduces the optical depth making the
photosphere region effectively larger, increasing the number of
photons escaping close to the line's center. 

However, for the central emission the transition to a single peak is
almost never completed in the range of explored parameters. The absence
of a single peak phase could be partially explained by the absence of a
photosphere. In this case the average number of scatterings to escape
should remain close to constant as the rotational velocity
increases. The rise in intensity at the line's center could instead
mean that the scattering in a medium with bulk motion are inefficient
in driving photons outside that frequency region.

In order to explore our interpretation for these two scenarios we now 
quantify the effect of rotation on the number of scatterings.

\subsection{Average Number of Scatterings}

\end{center}
    \caption{2D histogram of $N_{\rm scatt}$ vs $x$. The upper (lower) panels
      show the homogeneous (central) source distribution. Left panels 
      corresponds to the static case and right panels correspond to
      $V_{\rm max}=300\kms$. The color scale is logarithmic on the
      number of photons with given values of $N_{\rm scatt}$ and
      $x$. \label{fig:Nscatt2D}}   
\end{figure*}

The number of scatterings affects the escape frequency of a \ly photon.
In static cases, a large value of the optical depth correlates with a
high number of scatterings, increasing the probability of finding a
\ly photon far from the line's center. As a result the peak maxima
shifts from the center as the amount of neutral hydrogen
increases. This can be precisely quantified in the static slab
with central sources where the maxima position are related to
the optical depth and the temperature as $x_{m}=\pm 1.066(a\tau_{\rm
  H})^{1/3}$ \citep{Harrington73}. In the same model the average
number of scatterings depends only on the optical depth $\langle
N_{\rm  scatt}\rangle=1.612\tau_{\rm   H}$
\citep{Adams72,Harrington73}, in the case of homogeneously distributed
sources $\langle N_{\rm   scatt}\rangle=1.16\tau_{\rm   H}$
\citep{Harrington73}.   



In Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt} we show the average number of scatterings
$\langle N_{\rm scatt}\rangle$ as a function of the rotational velocity
$V_{\rm max}$. For the central source distribution the average number of
scatterings $\langle N_{\rm   scatt}\rangle$ changes less than $0.5\%$
for different velocities. In this set-up the number of scatterings is
proportional to the optical depth, with $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle= (1.50, 1.00, 0.92)\tau_{\rm   H}$ for optical depth
values of $\tau_{\rm H} = (10^{5}, 10^{6}, 10^{7})$ respectively.



In Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt} we can see the decrease of $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle$ as $V_{\rm max}$ increases in the homogeneous
source distribution. For instance, for
$\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$ the average number of scatterings decreases by
$61\%$ at $V_{\rm max}=300\kms$ in comparison to the static case.  

For the homogeneous static sphere we find that $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle= (0.99, 0.59, 0.51)\tau_{\rm   H}$, this
represents factors of $(0.66, 0.59, 0.55)$ lower than the centrally
emitted photons. While for the homogeneous rotating sphere at 
$V_{\rm{max}}=300\kms$ we find that $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle=(0.38, 0.34, 0.42)\tau_{\rm   H}$ which represents 
  factors of $(0.26, 0.34, 0.46)$ lower than the corresponding central
  case.  

In order to gain a deeper understanding of these results and explain
the results for the maxima in the line morphology we make 2D
histograms for the number of scatterings as a function of the outgoing
dimensionless frequency $x$. In Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt2D} we show
such histograms in the case $\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$ for the
static case and $V_{\rm max}=300$\kms. The upper (lower) panels show the
results for the homogeneous (central) source distribution. The color
scale is logarithmic in the number of photons at a certain value
$x-N_{\rm scatt}$. 

The top right panel of Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt2D} (homogeneous sources,
high rotational velocity) supports our hypothesis about
the photo-sphere in the homogeneous distribution. In this case most of
the photons that left with $x\sim 0$ have escaped with less than $10$
scatterings. This also explains the decrease in the average number of
scatterings observed in Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt}.

However, for a central distribution the situation is quite different
(lower panels). In this case the number of scatterings remains high,
in the order of the optical depth, but the two peaks do get closer to each
other. Here the most probable physical picture is that each
scattering, due to the bulk velocity of the gas, is inefficient in
driving the photon outside the line center.

    to different rotational velocities for the homogeneous models.

\end{figure*}

In the case of dusty clouds, all changes in the average number
of scatterings presented in the previous subsection have a direct
bearing on the escape fraction. From the results we have just obtained
we can predict that for central source distributions the escape
fraction will barely change, while larger effects should be expected
for homogeneously distributed sources. 

Left panel of Figure \ref{fig:efvsv} confirm these expectations. It shows the escape
fraction as a function of the rotational velocity. The curves for the
central source distribution stay flat, while for the homogeneous case
there is a clear rise with rotational velocity.  Rotation has a higher relative impact in
the models with low optical depth. For instance, in models with
$\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$, the static escape fraction is $0.26$ and increases
to $0.37$ for $V_{\rm max}=300$ \kms. Table \ref{table:escape} lists
all the values for the escape fraction. 

In the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:efvsv} we put these results in the context of
the analytic solution for the infinite slab \citep{Neufeld90}. In
Neufeld's set-up the analytic solution depends uniquely on the product
$(a\tau_{\rm   H})^{1/3}\tau_{A}$ where $\tau_{A} = (1 - A)\tau_{a}$ , an approximation 
that is valid only in the limit $a\tau_{\rm   H}\gg 1$. The dashed lines in
 the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:efvsv} show the results for the different rotational
velocities for the homogeneous models. First of all we note that the escape fraction does not
increase significantly from $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{5}$ to $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{6}$, This
 counter-intuitive result is a consequence of the transition into the 'extremely' opaque regime,
  which occurs roughly when $a\tau_{\rm{H}} > 10^{3}$ e.g. \citep{Neufeld90}.

\end{figure*}


Rotation breaks the spherical symmetry of the static model and
introduces the rotation axis as a preferred direction. This motivates
us to study the anisotropy of the outgoing photons. In order to study
possible deviations with respect to an isotropic flux we follow
\cite{Zheng2013} to estimate the flux as a function of the angle
$\Theta$ formed by the outgoing photons and the observer. Figure
\ref{fig:OCspheres} presents a geometric scheme to clarify the
definition of all relevant directions in the problem.

An estimator for the anisotropy is represented by
%
\begin{equation}
F(\mu) = \frac{2\Delta N}{N\Delta \mu}, 
\end{equation} 
%
where $\mu=\cos\Theta$, $N$ is the total number of outgoing photons,
$\Delta N$ is the number of photons in a angular bin $\Delta
\Theta$. This definition satisfies the condition
$\int_{-1}^{1}F(\mu)d\mu/2=1$.  With this definitions, the isotropic
emission is characterized by a flat $F(\mu)$ distribution. 


Figure \ref{fig:OCspheres} presents the results for the $F(\mu)$
distribution for a sphere with $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{7}$ and $V_{\rm
  max}=200$\kms. The dashed and dotted lines represent the homogeneous
and central source distribution, respectively. This shows that the
 anisotropy induced by rotation is at the $3\%$ level. We
performed the same test with all the models and find that the
variation in $\mu$ does not depend on the rotational velocity;
however, high optical depth values can increase the variation of
$\mu$ up to a $15\%$. 

We also explore a different source of anisotropy by studying the effect
of radiation sources located in off-centered spheres with respect to
the gas distribution. Figure \ref{fig:OCspheres} shows the two
spherical regions we define to test for this effect. Each has a radius
of $0.5R$, where $R$ is the radius of the gaseous sphere. With an
observer located along the $\hat{j}$ direction, we pick two possible
positions to center the spheres along the $\hat{i}$ axis: $\pm C\hat{i}$. In
this configuration the emitting sphere centered on $+C\hat{i}$ moves
towards the observer and the sphere centered on $-C\hat{j}$ moves
away from the observer. 


In this case the $\mu$ distribution is not homogeneous as it is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:muhisto}. The off-center emission shows a variation of flux at
the levels of $10\% - 28\%$ in intensity with the angle $\Theta$. In general 
models with a larger $\tau_{H}$ present a higher variation in the flux.


We also explore the effects of the off-centered emission in the line
morphology. Figure \ref{fig:OC_profiles} show the spectra for the two
off-centered emitting spheres located at $C=\pm0.5R$.  In this case we
only use photons that have outgoing directions aligned with the
observer i.e. $0.9 <\vert \mu \vert < 1.0$. We do not find any strong
asymmetry in the line morphology within the range of explored velocities.


However, we find some cases where there is a possible signature of
triple peaked emission. This is only present in some models
($\tau_{\rm H} = 10^6, V=100$\kms and $\tau_{\rm H} = 10^7,
V=300$\kms) and could be the result of two competing effects: the rise
in the line's center as the photons in the photosphere escape in a
single excursion and the broadening in the two peaks as the photons
closer from the center have to scatter to escape. We examine in
greater detail these cases in the next sub-section. 



\subsection{Triple Peaked Profiles}
\label{sec:3p}

The off-centered cases with hints of triple peaked emission motivate us
to explore this in more detail. The first condition is to increase the
number of photons in the radiative transfer calculation. In the line
profiles presented in the previous subsection, only $\sim 10^4$ photons
have the geometric conditions to build the line profile. We run a few
models with $N_{\gamma} = 10^6$ in order to improve the statistics and
explore smaller radii for the off-centered spheres.

We re-simulate four models that presented some signs of triple peaked
profiles: $V_{\rm max}=50\kms$, $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{5}$; $V_{\rm
  max}=100\kms$, $\tau_{H}=10^{6}$; $V_{\rm max}=150\kms$, $\tau_{\rm
  H}=10^6$; and $V_{\rm max}=200\kms$, $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{7}$. We
select the photons that were emitted within spheres of radius $0.25R$
centered at $C=(0.25R, 0.5R, 0.75R)$, following the same
geometry presented in Figure \ref{fig:OCspheres}.

Figure \ref{fig:3p_profiles} summarizes the results for all these
models. In all cases the stronger triple peaked signatures is
presented by the emitting spheres close centered at $0.75R$ close to
the surface. Emitting spheres closer to the center do not show clear
signatures for a triple peaked emission.

Furthermore, taking into account all the models that do not present hints for
a triple peaked emission it would seem that the rotational velocity
and optical depth must balance each other in order to show this feature.
 Namely, if the rotational velocity is close to half the FWHM
of the line, the triple peaks are more likely to occur. This is the
same threshold that in the case of centered emission marks the
difference between double and single peaked lines.


Are these features observable with current instrumental capabilities?
As an order of magnitude estimate we can consider that the width of
each one of the triple peaks is close to $1/3$ of the FWHM of the line
at a given $V_{\rm max}$. For the cases we have studied in this
subsection those values would be close to $50\kms$, $100\kms$ and
$200\kms$ for optical depths of $10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7$
respectively. At a redshift of $z\sim 2-3$ each one of these widths
is multiplied by factors of $z+1\sim 3-4$. Considering a nominal value
for the resolution of $\Delta v=200\kms$ for a Near-IR spectrograph capable of observing
those galaxies \citep{Kulas12}, we find that only the case of triple
peaked emission for the most massive object $\tau_{\rm H}, 10^{7}$,
$V_{\rm max}=200\kms$ would have a chance to be spectrally resolved. 


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Gas bulk rotation has a noticeable effect on the morphology of the
 \ly line. In this section we discuss the implications of these
 findings for the interpretation of available observational data. Our
 discussion focuses on the qualitative aspects of diverse
 morphological features observed by \cite{Kulas12} and \cite{Yamada2012}


We follow a classification of \ly profiles made by
\cite{Kulas12}. They presented observational results for star forming
galaxies at $z=2$-$3$ with multiple peaks in their \ly emission.
They classified the observed lines into five groups. In Group I the
red peak is stronger than the blue, while in Group II the blue peak is
stronger, in both cases the peaks are symmetrically located around the
line center. In Group III the blue peak also dominates but there is an
overall redward shift of the zero point. Group IV presents two similar
peaks symmetrically located around the zero point and Group V galaxies show
three peaks. 

The asymmetries in Groups I, II  and III cannot be explained by
rotation. However, some galaxies in those groups have a high flux between
the two peaks; this could indicate the presence of rotation 
and \ly photons leaking though low column density holes, as in \cite{Behrens2014}. The same argument applies to galaxies in the group IV in which the flux
in between of the two peaks is high ($ \geq 70 \%$ of the intensity in
the highest peak). Finally, the triple peaked lines in Galaxies in
Group V can be reproduced by rotation with off-centered
emission given the right amount of asymmetry between the emitting
region and neutral hydrogen distribution. 

Another relevant sample of observations was presented by \cite{Yamada2012} 
for 91 LAEs at $z=3.1$. They find that $\sim 33 \%$ of the galaxies present 
a single peak profile. Some of the peaks have a strong symmetry, while
others do not. The symmetric single peaked profile can be explained by
rotation effects, while the asymmetric cases naturally arise in
outflow/inflow models \citep{Ahn2014,Verhamme2008, Dijkstra06}. Among the 91
LAEs, 8 reveal triple peaked profiles with a central peak and two
smaller peaks at the redder and bluer side, a feature that is present
in our off-center emission models with rotation Figure \ref{fig:3p_profiles}. 

The presence of single peaked profiles has been associated to
inflow/outflow dynamics \citep{Verhamme06,DijkstraKramer}. In this
paper we show that gas bulk rotation can also be considered as a
probable origin for that behavior, provided that the observed single peak is highly
symmetric. Similarly, in the case of double peaked lines with a high
level of flux at the line center, rotation also deserves to be considered in
the pool of possible bulk flows responsible for that feature,
specially if the two peaks have similar intensities. The case of
triple peaked lines is another clear feature of gas rotation under the
additional condition of an off-centered emission. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper quantifies for the first time in the literature the effects
of rotation in the morphology of the \ly emission line in star forming
galaxies.  The results are based on the study of an homogeneous sphere
of gas with solid body rotation. We explore a range of models by varying
the rotational speed, hydrogen optical depth, dust optical depth and
initial distribution of \ly photons with respect to the gas
density. As a cross-validation, we obtain our results from two
independently developed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer codes. 

Our main result is that rotation clearly impacts the \ly line
morphology. Double peaked lines can make transitions into single
peaked lines as the rotational velocity increases. In the case of
off-centered emission we obtain triple peaked lines for certain
values of optical depth and rotational velocities. 

Quantitatively the main results of our study are summarized as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item The line width increases with rotational velocity. The line width
  approximately follows the functional for  ${\rm FWHM}^2 = {\rm FWHM}_{
    0}^2 + (V_{\rm max}/\lambda)^2$ where FWHM$_{0}$ indicates the line
  width for the static case and $\lambda$ is a constant determined from
  the radiative transfer results it is $\lambda_{\rm c}=3.89\pm0.04$ and
  $\lambda_{\rm h}=1.98\pm0.06$ for the central and homogeneous source
  distribution, respectively.


\item A single peaked line emerges for high rotational velocities in
  the case of homogeneously distributed sources. These cases occur when
  the rotational velocity is larger than half FWHM$_0$.  

\item For central sources we find that the number of scatterings
does not significantly decrease with rotation. This is due to the 
fact that the vast majority of scatterings events are resonant, 
during which the mean free path is very short and the effect of gas
bulk rotation is not enough to affect \ly photons. In consequence, 
the escape fraction neither the position of the peaks depends on the
rotational velocity. However, there is a flux increase with rotational
velocity in the central parts of the line.


\item For homogeneous sources we find that the changes in the
line morphology are linked to the reduction in the average number of
scatterings. In the second part of \S \ref{sec:widthpeak} we show
that, as rotational velocity increases, a large fraction of photons
escape with less than $10$ scatterings. The average number of
scatterings decreases a $40\%$ compared to the static case. 
This reduction in the number of scatterings decreases the probability
for a photon to move away from the line's center. This is also
translated into an increase of the escape fraction by a factor of
$\sim 2$ with respect to the static situation.

\item The spatial anisotropy induced by rotation in the emission is
  usually below the $10\%$ level.

\item For off-centered emission triple peaked profiles can emerge
  under two joint conditions: the emission occurs close to the sphere's
  surface and the rotational velocity is close to half the FWHM in the
  static case.   
\end{itemize}

Comparing our results with recent observed LAEs we find that many 
morphological features such as high central line flux, single peak
profiles and multiple-peaked profiles could be explained by gas bulk 
rotation present in these LAEs. We defer the study of triple peaked
emission in the context of gas bulk rotation to a future publication
(Remolina-Gutierrez et al., in preparation).
