\begin{abstract}
%For the first the effect of gas bulk rotation on the morphology 
%of the Lyman $\alpha$ line is studied using radiative transfer calculations.
We present results of radiative transfer calculations to measure
the impact of gas bulk rotation on the morphology of the Lyman $\alpha$ line in galaxies. 
We model a galaxy as a sphere with a
homogeneous mixture of dust and hydrogen at a constant
temperature. These spheres have a solid-body rotation with
maximum velocities in the range $0-300$ \kms and neutral
hydrogen optical depths in the range $\tau_{\rm
H}=10^{5}-10^{7}$. We also consider two kinds of spatial
distribution for the radiation sources with respect to the sphere:
central and homogeneous. We find that the line width and the intensity
at the line's center increases with rotational velocity. In the case of homogeneously distributed
sources, for large rotational velocities the line transforms from a
double peak to a single peak at the line center. Under the same
conditions the escape fraction increases $\sim 30\%$. For
radiation sources located off-center, the line morphology presents a
range of single, double and triple peaked lines. We show how these results are
useful to interpret recent spectroscopic results of distant $z\sim 2-3$ star
forming galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The detection of strong \ly emission lines has become an essential
method in extra-galactic astronomy to find distant star-forming
galaxies
\citep{PartridgePeebles,Rhoads00,Gawiser2007,Koehler2007,Ouchi08,Yamada2012,Schenker2012}.
The galaxies detected using this method receive the 
name of \ly emitters (LAEs). A detailed examination of this galaxy
population has diverse implications for galaxy formation, reionization
and the large scale structure of the Universe. Attempts to fully
exploit the physical information included in the \ly line require an
understanding of all the physical factors involved in shaping the
line. Due to the resonant nature of this line, these physical factors
notably include temperature, density and bulk velocity field of the neutral
Hydrogen in the emitting galaxy and its surroundings.


A basic understanding of the quantitative behavior of the \ly line
has been reached through analytic studies in the case of a static
configurations, such as uniform slabs
\citep{Harrington73,Neufeld90} and uniform spheres
\citep{Dijkstra06}. Analytic studies of configurations including
some kind of bulk flow only include the case of a sphere with a Hubble
like expansion flow \citep{LoebRybicki}. 

A quantitative description of the \ly line has been reached through
Monte Carlo simulations \citep{Auer68,Avery68,Adams72}. In the last
two decades these studies have become popular due to the
availability of computing power. Early into the 21st century the first
studies focused on homogeneous and static media
\citep{Ahn00,Ahn01,Zheng02}. Later on the effects of clumpy media
\citep{Hansen06} and expanding/contracting shell/spherical geometries started to
be studied \citep{Verhamme06,Dijkstra06}. Similar codes have applied
these results to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation \citep{Orsi12} and
results of large hydrodynamic simulations
\citep{CLARA,Forero12,Behrens13}. Recently Monte Carlo codes have also
been applied to the results of high resolution hydrodynamic
simulations of individual
galaxies\citep{Laursen09,Barnes11,Verhamme12,Yajima12}. While, recent
developments have been focused on the systematic study of clumpy
outflows \citep{DijkstraKramer}and anisotropic velocity configurations
\citep{Zheng2013}. 

The recent studies of galaxies in hydrodynamic simulations
\citep{Laursen09,Barnes11,Verhamme12,Yajima12} have all shown
systematic variations in the \ly line with the viewing angle. These
variations are a complex superposition of anisotropic density
configurations (i.e. edge-on vs. face-on view of a galaxy), the
inflows observed by gas cooling and the outflows included in the
supernova feedback process of the simulation. These bulk flows
physically correspond to the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium
(CGM and IGM). These effects are starting to be studied
 in simplified configurations that vary the density and wind
 characteristics \citep{Zheng2013}. 

However, in all these efforts the effect of rotation,
which is an ubiquitous feature in galaxies, has not been
systematically studied. The processing of the \ly photons in a
rotating interstellar medium (ISM) must have some kind of impact in
the \ly line morphology. 

Performing that study is the main goal of this paper. We investigate for the
first time the impact of rotation on the morphology of the \ly line. We focus on a simplified system, a spherical gas cloud
with homogeneous density and solid body rotation, to study the line
morphology and the escape  fraction in the presence of dust. We base
our work on two independent Monte Carlo based radiative transfer codes
CLARA \citep{CLARA} and XX \citep{DijkstraKramer} .   
  
 
This paper is structured as follows. In \S
\ref{sec:implementation} we present the implementation of bulk
rotation into the Monte Carlo codes, paying special attention to coordinate
definitions. We also list the different physical parameters in
the simulated grid of models. In the next \S \ref{sec:results} we present the
results of the simulations, with special detail to quantities in the
line that show a clear evolution as a function of the sphere
rotational velocity. In \S \ref{sec:discussion} we discuss the
implications of our results in the interpretation of LAEs
observations and further refinements that can be implemented in the
theoretical modeling of the \ly line. In the last section we present
our conclusions. 

In this paper we express a photon's frequency in terms of the
dimensionless variable $x\equiv (\nu -\nu_a)/\Delta\nu_\alpha$, where
$\nu_{\alpha}=2.46\times 10^{15}$ Hz is the Ly$\alpha$ resonance
frequency,  $\Delta\nu_{\alpha} \equiv
\nu_{\alpha}\sqrt{2kT/m_pc^2}\equiv \nu_av_{\rm th}/c $ is the Doppler
broadening of the line which depends on the neutral gas temperature
$T$ scattering the radiation or equivalently the thermal velocity
$v_{\rm th}$ of the atoms. 


\section{Models of bulk gas rotation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Describing the kinematics of gas rotation in all generality is a
complex task, specially at high redshift where there is still missing
a thorough observational account of rotation in galaxies beyond
$z>1.0$. Event at low red-shifts there is a great
variation in the shape of the rotation curve as observed in HI
emission as a function of the distance to the galaxy center. However
there are two recurrent features. First, in the
central galactic region the velocity increases proportional to the radius,
following a solid rotation behavior. Second, beyond a certain radius
the rotation curve tends to flatten.  

An ab-initio description of realistic rotation curves in simulations
depends on having access to the dynamic evolution of all mass components
in the galaxy: stars, gas and dark matter. Such level of realism is
extremely complex to achieve, specially if one wants to get a
systematic description based on statistics of simulated objects.

Following the tradition of studies of \ly emitting systems,
we implement a model with simplified geometry. We assume that the gas
is homogeneously distributed in a sphere that rotates as a solid body
with constant angular velocity. This simple model will contain only
one free parameter: the linear velocity at the sphere's surface, $V_{\rm
  max}$. 

\subsection{Detailed Implementation of Rotation}

 In the Monte Carlo code we define a Cartesian coordinate system to
 describe the position of each photon. The origin of this system
 coincides with the center of the sphere and the rotation axis is defined
 to be $z$-axis. With this choice, the components of the gas bulk velocity
 field, $\vec{v} = v_{x}\hat{i} + v_{y}\hat{j} + v_{z}\hat{k}$, can be
 written as  
  
\begin{equation}
    v_{x}=-\frac{y}{R}V_{\rm max}, \label{subeq1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    v_{y}=\frac{x}{R}V_{\rm max}, \label{subeq2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    v_{z}=0, \label{subeq3}
\end{equation}
%
where $R$ is the radius of the sphere and $V_{\rm max}$ is the linear
velocity at the sphere's surface. The minus/plus sign in the
$x$/$y$-component of the velocity indicates the direction of
rotation. In this case we take the angular velocity in the same
direction as the $\hat{k}$ unit vector. With these definitions we can
write the angular velocity as $\omega=V_{\rm max}/R$.  

For each photon in the simulation we have its initial position inside
the sphere, direction of propagation $\hat{k}_{in}$ and reduced
frequency $x_{in}$. The photon's propagation stops once they cross the
surface of the sphere. At this point we store the position, the outgoing direction
of propagation $\hat{k}_{out}$ and the reduced frequency $x_{out}$. We
define the angle $\Theta$ by $\cos\Theta = \hat{k}\cdot
\hat{k}_{out}$, that is the polar angle of the outgoing photon with
respect to the $z$ axis. Following \cite{Zheng2013} we make the study
of the anisotropic emission in terms of this angle..



\subsection{Grid of Simulated Galaxies}
\label{sec:models}

In the Monte Carlo calculations we follow the propagation of $N_{\gamma}=10^5$
numerical photons through different spherical galaxies. For each galaxy
we vary at least one of the following parameters: the maximum
rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$, the hydrogen optical depth $\tau_{H}$,
the dust optical depth $\tau_{a}$ and the initial distribution of photons
with respect to the gas. There are $60$ models initial combining all
variations of the input parameters. Table \ref{table:models}
summarizes the models.

Additionally, we have used two independently developed Monte Carlo
codes \citep{CLARA,DijkstraKramer} to perform the calculations of the
non-dusty models. The results we report are robust in the sense
that they are obtained by both codes. 

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llc}\hline\hline
Physical Parameter (units) & Symbol & Values\\\hline
Velocity (\kms) & $V_{\rm max}$&$0,\ 50,\ 100,\ 200,\ 300$\\
Hydrogen Optical Depth & $\tau_{H} $ & $10^{5},\ 10^{6},\ 10^{7}$\\
Dust Optical Depth & $\tau_{a}$ & $0$,$1$\\
Photons Distributions & & Central, Homogeneous\\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{

  vary the values in the range listed in the last column. Taking into
  account all the possible combinations we end up with $60$ different
  models.}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

    distributions with $\tau_{H}=10^{7}$. The left (right) panel shows
    the central (homogeneous) photon distribution. All photons were

    \label{fig:differentvelocities}}  
\end{figure*}

The central result of this paper is summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:differentvelocities}. It shows the evident
impact of rotation on the morphology of the emergent \ly line. Both
panels focus on the results for $\tau_{H}=10^{7}$, showing that the
influence of rotation is present both when the photons are either
homogeneously or centrally initialized over the gas volume.  

In the next subsections we characterize the line morphology by
the half-width at half intensity and the peak maxima. In order to
interpret the morphological changes in the line we also report the
median number of scatter for each \ly photon in the
simulation. For the models where dust is included we measure the 
escape fraction as a function of rotational velocity. Finally, we make
an estimate of the anisotriopic emission of the models in comparison
with static spheres.


\subsection{Line width and peak maxima}
\label{sec:widthpeak}


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{NewWidthVvsVmax.png}
    \caption{Half-width for the non-dusty models as a function of
      rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$. Continuous (dashed) lines
      correspond to homogeneous (central) source
      distributions. \label{fig:widthvsvelocity}} 
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{maximumVvsVmax.png}
\caption{Position of the peak maxima as a function of rotational
  velocity $V_{\rm max}$. Continuous (dashed) lines correspond to
  homogeneous (central) source distributions. A value of $x_{\rm
    max}=0$ indicates that line becomes single
  peaked. \label{fig:maximumsvsvelocity}}  
\end{figure}

The first quantitative conclusion of the effect of rotation in the
\ly line is that double peaks broaden and reduce their intensity
while the line center rises. This gives the impression that, as the
rotational velocity increases, the double peaks are merged into a
single broad emission peak. This is most evident at the highest
rotational velocities for the homogeneously distributed sources
(right panel in Figure \ref{fig:differentvelocities}). 

To quantify the line broadening we use the width at half maximum
(FWHM), $W_{1/2}$. Figure \ref{fig:widthvsvelocity} shows how $W_{1/2}$ increases
with rotational velocity. Continuous (dashed) lines connect the
results for homogeneous (central) source distribution. For the
temperature $T=10^4$K used in our radiative transfer calculations the
thermal velocity is $v_{th}=12.8$\kms. For a model with $\tau_{H}$ it
means that the FWHM increase up to $350$\kms (at $V_{\rm
  max}=300$\kms) compared to $150$\kms in the static case.   

Figure \ref{fig:maximumsvsvelocity} shows the position for the peak
maxima as a function of the rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$. This
Figure clearly shows that in the case of central distributed
sources there is barely any change with rotational velocity in the
range of explored parameters. However, in the case of
homogeneously emitted sources the maxima position remain close to
constant until beyond some velocity threshold the line becomes single
peaked with $x_{\rm m}=0$ \kms. 

The transition to a single peaked line seems to occur in systems
where it is easier for the bulk of the photons to escape with the lowest
number of scatterings possible, allowing them not to move very far
from the center of the line. This might explain how the single peak stage
is easily achieved in the homogeneous source distribution. In this
case there is a fraction of the photons that are inside a photo-sphere
region with $\tau_{H,r}\ll \tau_{H}$ where $\tau_{H,r}$ is the optical
depth from the radius of emission to the sphere's surface. These
conditions allows the photons to escape with much less scatterings
compared to the photons emitted at the very center of the sphere. In
turn, it gives the photons less scatterings to be placed far from the
line center. 

Increasing the rotational velocity $V_{\rm max}$ reduces
the optical depth making the photo-sphere region effectively larger,
increasing the number of photons escaping close to the line's
center. In our models we find the following correspondence between the
optical depth $\tau_{\rm H}=\{10^5, 10^6, 10^7\}$ and the transitional
velocities $V_{\rm   trans}=\{50-100\kms, 100-200\kms, 200-300\kms\}$
which can only be constrained to be in the range of velocities in the
models that gave a $x_{\rm max}\neq 0$ and $x_{\rm max}=0$.  

For the central emission the transition to a single peak is never
completed in the range of explored parameters. The non appearance
of a single peak phase can be in part explained to the absence of a
photo-sphere, as is the case in the homogeneous
distribution. Nevertheless, there is a rise in the intensity at the
line center as the rotational velocity increases. This hints that the
encounters with a non static medium are inefficient in pushing photons
outside the line's center.

In the next sub-section we quantify the number of scatterings and explore
to what extent this is related to the emergence of single peaked emission. 

\subsection{Average Number of Scatterings}


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{NscattvsVmax.png}
\caption{Logarithm of the average number of scatterings as function of
  rotational velocity velocity. Continuous (dashed) lines represent an
  homogeneous (central) distribution of sources. \label{fig:Nscatt}}    
\end{figure}


\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{2dHistogram0t5HOM.png}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{2dHistogram300t5HOM.png}\\
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{2dHistogram0t5.png}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{2dHistogram300t5.png}    
\end{center}
    \caption{2D histogram of $N_{\rm scatt}$ vs $x$. The upper (lower) panels
      show the homogeneous (central) source distribution. Left
      corresponds to the static case and the right
      $V_{max}=300km/s$. The color scale is logarithmic on the
      number of photons with given values of $N_{\rm scatt}$ and
      $x$. \label{fig:Nscatt2D}}   
\end{figure*}


The number of \ly photon scatterings affects its final frequency after
escaping the galaxy. In static gas geometries, a large value of the
optical depth correlates with a high number of scatterings, increasing
the probability of finding a \ly photon far from the center of the
line. In these cases the peak maxima shifts away from the line center as
the amount of neutral hydrogen increases. 


In Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt} we show the average number of scatterings
$\langle N_{\rm scatt}\rangle$ as a function of the rotational velocity
$V_{\rm max}$. For the central distributions the average number of
scatterings has a modest change for increasing rotational
velocities, $\langle N_{\rm scatt}\rangle$ changes less than $0.5\%$
for different velocities. In the same set-up the average
number of scatterings is proportional to the optical depth, as
expected in analogy from the analytic result for the homogeneous
infinite-slab $\langle N_{\rm  scatt}\rangle=1.612\tau_{\rm   H}$
\citep{Adams72,Harrington73}. In the spheres with centrally
distributed sources we find $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle= (1.50, 1.00, 0.92)\tau_{\rm   H}$ for optical depths
$\tau_{\rm H} = (10^{5}, 10^{6}, 10^{7})$


Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt} shows that for the homogeneous distribution
there is a clear decrease of $\langle N_{\rm  scatt}\rangle$ as the
$V_{\rm max}$ increases. This effect is more pronounced for lower
values of the optical depth. For $\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$ the average
number of scatterings decreases by $61\%$ at $V_{\rm max}=300\kms$ in
comparison to the static case. 


The analytic expectation for the average number of scatterigs in a
slab with homogeneously distributed sources is $\langle N_{\rm
  scatt}\rangle=1.16\tau_{\rm   H}$ \citep{Harrington73}. This is
$0.72$ times lower than the same case with photons emitted in the
slab's center. In our case we find that for the static case and the
homogeneously distributed sources $\langle N_{\rm scatt}\rangle=
(0.99, 0.59, 0.51)\tau_{\rm   H}$, this represents factors of $(0.66,
0.59, 0.55)$ lower than the centrally emitted  photons.  

In order to gain a deeper understanding of these results we make 2D
histograms for the number of scatterings as a function of the outgoing
dimensionless frequency $x$. In Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt2D} we show
such histogram in the case $\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$ for the
static case and $V_{\rm max}=300$\kms. The upper (lower) panels show the
results for the homogeneous (central) source distribution. The color
scale is logarithmic in the number of photons at a certain value
$x-N_{\rm scatt}$. 

The top right panel of Figure \ref{fig:Nscatt2D} supports our hypothesis about
the photo-sphere in the homogeneous distribution. In that case most of
the photons that left with $x\sim 0$ have escaped with less than $10$
scatterings. This explains the origin of a single central
peak. However, for a central distribution the situation is
different. In this case the number of scatterings remains high, in the
order of the optical depth, but the two peaks do get closer to each
other. In this case the physical picture is that each scattering, due
to the bulk velocity of the gas, is inefficient in driving the photon
outside the line center. 


\subsection{Dusty Clouds: Escape Fraction}
\label{sec:escapefraction}


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{escapefraction.png}
   \caption{Escape fraction as a function of rotational velocity, for these models we took $\tau_{a}=1$. The
     continuous (dashed) lines correspond to homogeneous (central)
     models.
     \label{fig:efvsv}}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Neufeld.png}
 \caption{Escape fraction as a function of the
   product $(a\tau_{\rm H})^{1/3}\tau_{a}$. The analytic solution for
   the infinite slab is shown as a continuous line. Different dashed
   lines correspond to different rotational velocities, for this models 
   $\tau_a = 1$.
   \label{fig:efvsNeufeld}}   
\end{figure}

The average number of scatterings is also reflected in the amount of
photons absorbed by dust. Under these considerations we do not expect
any change in the escape fraction for a dusty cloud with central
source of radiation given that the number of scatterings remains close
to constant. On the other hand, in the case of a homogeneous
radiation source the number of scatterings drops as $V_{\rm max}$
increases, which has to be reflected as an increasing escape fraction.

Figure \ref{fig:efvsv} shows the dependence of the escape fraction as
a function of the maximum rotational velocity, confirming our expectations. For the central source
distribution the escape fraction barely shows any change, while for
the homogeneous case there is a clear increase in the escape fraction for
high rotational velocities.  Rotation has a higher relative impact in
the models with low optical depth $\tau_{\rm H}=10^5$,$10^{6}$, where
it can rise from $(0.26, 0.28)$ ($V_{\rm}=0$\kms) up to $(0.37, 0.39)$ ($V_{\rm
  rot}=300$ \kms). 

In Figure \ref{fig:efvsNeufeld} we put these results in the context of
the analytic solution for the infinite slab \citep{Neufeld90}. In
Neufeld's set-up the analytic solution depends uniquely on the product
$(a\tau_{\rm   H})^{1/3}\tau_{a}$, an approximation that is valid only
in the limits where $a\tau_{\rm   H}\gg 1$. The dashed lines in Figure
\ref{fig:efvsNeufeld} correspond to the cases of different
velocities. First of all we note that the escape fraction does not
increase from $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{5}$ to $\tau_{\rm H}=10^{6}$, this is
explained since there is a transition from a opaque to an extremely opaque medium
which affect affects how \ly photons scape from the medium: single flight 
vs single excursion.
 %we are in a regime where the condition for the analytic expectations  ($a\tau_{h}\gg 1$) does not hold. 
This figure also shows that the escape fraction is higher by factors of $2-10$
than the expectation for a slab with centrally distributed
sources. Furthermore, the decrease of the escape fraction with
increasing optical depth is also slower.

\subsection{Off-Centered emission}
\label{sec:off-center}
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{OF_spheres.png}
  \caption{The two solid circles show the two different spherical
    off-centered emitting  regions. The angular velocity vector is
    defined to be along the $\hat{\i}$ direction (where the reader is) 
    and the observer is along the $\hat{\j}$ direction. 
    \label{fig:OCspheres}} 
\end{figure}

The raw data from the model with homogeneous radiation sources allows
to study the effect of radiation sources distributed with a different
symmetry than the gas. We can select photons emitted in off-centered spheres 
with respect to the gas distribution and check whether this produces
asymmetries in the line.


Figure \ref{fig:OCspheres} shows the two spherical regions we
define to test for this effect. Each has a radius of $0.5$R and can
have two possible centers positions $C$ along the $\hat{\j}$ direction:
$\pm C\hat{\i}$. We also place an observer along the $\hat{\j}$
direction, such that the emitting sphere centered on $+C\hat{\j}$ moves
away from the observer and the sphere centered on $+C\hat{\j}$ moves
towards the observer. 

We study first the angular deviations of the outgoing photons with respect
to an isotropic flux. We follow \cite{Zheng2013} to estimate the flux
as a function of the angle $\Theta$ formed by the outgoing photons and
the observer. This is expressed by 

\begin{equation}
F(\mu) = \frac{2\Delta N}{N\Delta \mu}, 
\end{equation} 
%
where $\mu=\cos\Theta$, $N$ is the total number of outgoing photons,
$\Delta N$ is the number of photons in a angular bin $\Delta
\Theta$. This definition satisfies the condition
$\int_{-1}^{1}F(\mu)d\mu/2=1$.  

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{muhisto.png}
  \caption{$\mu$ histogram showing the orientation effects for the different
  distributions Central(Points line), Homogeneous(Dashed) and Off-Center(Solid line).  
    \label{fig:muhisto}} 
\end{figure}

The variations in the $\mu$ distribution is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:muhisto},
for the Off-Center model there is a strong dependence of the 
observed flux on the relative position of an observer with $\Delta\mu\leq 25\%$.
In contrast,the central and homogeneous source distributions only show a 
weak anisotropy at the level of $\Delta\mu\leq 3\%$. The variations
in $\mu$ does not depend on the rotational velocity while increasing the optical depth $\tau_{H}$
would also increase the variation of $\Delta\mu$ up to a $15\%$.


Figure \ref{fig:OC_profiles} show the spectra for the two off-centered
spheres located at $C=\pm0.5R$.  In this case we only use photons that
have outgoing directions aligned with the observer i.e $\vert \mu \vert > 
0.9$ $\&$ $\vert \mu \vert < 1.0]$.  We do not find any asymmetry in 
the line produced by the off-center emission, the difference
 between the profiles corresponding to the spheres located at $C=-0.5R$ 
 and that ones located at $C=0.5R$ is negligible.  As in the homogeneous / 
central model the line gets broader as the rotational velocity increase also 
the central part of the line becomes predominant . 
There is also a signature of possible three peaks profiles for some models ($\tau = 10^6,
V=100,200$\kms and $\tau = 10^7, V=200,300$\kms) which would be studied 
in detail in the next section.

\end{figure*}

As mentioned above Off-centered emission shows signs of three peak 
profiles, to analyse this in more detail we use the same method of the spheres
explained in \S \ref{sec:off-center}. We select spheres at $C=(\pm 0.25R, \pm0.5R, \pm0.75R)$ with a radii of
$0.25R$ for all the models, for those who present signs of three peak profiles such as 
$(V_{max}=50km$ $s^{-1}$ \& $\tau_{H}=10^{5}), (V_{max}=100km$ $s^{-1}$ \& $\tau_{H}=10^{6}), 
(V_{max}=200km$ $s^{-1}$ \& $\tau_{H}=10^{7})$ we made another run with $\tau_{\gamma}=10^{6}$ 
with the aim of get a stronger profile. 

Fig. \ref{fig:3p_profiles} shows our findings, in order to get such profiles 
a relation between optical depth, rotational velocity and $C$ must be accomplish.
In particular we found that for the outer spheres $C=\pm 0.75$ the three
peak arises for all of our models with $\tau_{\gamma}=10^{6}$ this is due to 
the fact that the wings of the line move away from the central part as $C$ increase. 
Another requirement is that a high optical depth must be balanced with a high velocity 
in order to make the wings and the central peak similar in 
height, for models in which the velocity is low spheres at $C = \pm 0.25$ produce 
noise three peak profiles.

Fig.\ref{fig:3p_res} show that even with a low resolution a three-peak profile 
would be observed, this is important for observational porpoises due to the finite 
spectral resolution.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Gas bulk rotation has a noticeable effect on the morphology of the
 \ly line. In this section we discuss the implications of these
 findings for the interpretation of available observational data. Our
 discussion focuses on the qualitative aspects of diverse
 morphological features observed by \cite{Kulas12} ans \cite{Yamada2012}


We follow a classification of \ly profiles made by
\cite{Kulas12}. They presented observational results for star forming
galaxies at $z=2$-$3$ with multiple peaks in their \ly emission.
They classified the observed lines into five groups. In Group I the
red peak is stronger than the blue, while in Group II the blue peak is
stronger, in both cases the peaks are symmetrically located around the
line center. In Group III the blue peak also dominates but there is an
overall redward shift of the zero point. Group IV presents two similar
peaks symmetrically located around the zero point and Group V galaxies show
three peaks. 

The asymmetries in Groups I, II  and III cannot be explained by
rotation. However, some galaxies in those groups have a high flux between
the two peaks; an effect can be induced by rotation. The same
argument applies to galaxies in the group IV in which the flux
in between of the two peaks is high ($ \geq 70 \%$ of the intensity in
the highest peak). Finally, the triple peaked lines in Galaxies in
Group V can be easily reproduced by rotation with off-centered
emission given the right amount of asymmetry between the emitting
region and neutral hydrogen distribution. 

Another relevant sample of observations was presented by \cite{Yamada2012} 
for 91 LAEs at $z=3.1$. They find that $\sim 33 \%$ of the galaxies present 
a single peak profile. Some of the peaks have a strong symmetry, while
others do not. The symmetric single peaked profile can be explained by
rotation effects, while the asymmetric cases naturally arise in
outflow/inflow models \citep{Verhamme2008, Dijkstra06}. Among the 91
LAEs, 8 reveal triple peaked profiles with a central peak and two
smaller peaks at the redder and bluer side, a feature that is present
in our off-center emission models with rotation. 

The presence of single peaked profiles has been associated to
inflow/outflow dynamics \citep{XXX}. In this paper we show that gas
bulk rotation can also be considered as a probable origin for that
behavior, provided that the observed single peak is highly
symmetric. Similarly, in the case of double peaked lines with a high
level of flux at the line center, rotation also deserves to be considered in
the pool of possible bulk flows responsible for that feature,
specially if the two peaks have similar intensities. The case of
triple peaked lines is another clear feature of gas rotation under the
additional condition of an off-centered emission. 

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper illustrates for the first time the main effects of rotation
in the morphology of the \ly emission line in star forming galaxies. 
The results are based on the study of an homogeneous sphere
with solid body rotation. We explored a range of models by varying
the rotational speed, hydrogen optical depth, dust optical depth and
initial distribution of \ly photons with respect to the gas
density. As a cross-validation, we obtain our results from two
independently developed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer codes.

Our main result is that rotation clearly impact the \ly line
morphology. Double peaked lines can make transitions into single
peaked lines as the rotational velocity increases. Additional
off-centered emission result into triple peaked lines for certain 
values of optical depth and velocities. 

\begin{itemize}
\item For central sources we find that the number of scatterings
does not significantly decrease with rotation, this is due to the 
fact that the vast majority of scatterings events are resonant 
during which the mean free path is very short and the effect of gas
bulk rotation is not enough to affect \ly photons.
The escape fraction does not depend on the rotational velocity neither
the position of the peaks, but there is an increase 
in the flux on the central parts of the line for high rotational 
velocities.

\item For homogeneous sources we find the changes in the
line morphology are linked to the reduction in the average number of
scatterings. In the second part of \S \ref{sec:widthpeak} we show
that, as rotational velocity increases, a large fraction of photons
escape with less than $10$ scatterings and on average 
with $40\%$ less scatterings than in the static case. This makes highly improbable 
that a photon's frequency can move away from the line's center. 
In \S \ref{sec:widthpeak} For typical column densities of $N_{HI}=1e^{19}-1e^{20}$, 
we find that rotational velocities of 100-300 \kms broaden the line profile up 
to a factor of $2-3$ in comparison to the static case. Simultaneously, the
flux in the line center also increases with rotational velocity. This
increase induces the transition from a double peak to a single peak
line in the models where the radiation sources are homogeneously
distributed. Also the escape fraction increase by factors of $2-10$ with 
respect to the slab with centrally sources.

\item For non-symmetric sources we find that three peak profiles
could emerge for models in which the rotational velocity is the necessary 
to give rise to a central peak but also not that high to decrease the
amount of photons in the wings. When initial off-center sources are 
selected from the outer parts of the galaxy the wings of the line are stronger.
Also off-center emission do not produce any considerable asymmetries in the line.
\end{itemize}

%We have quantified the results in different aspects. 

%These changes in the number of scatterings have a direct bearing on
%the escape fraction in the presence of dust.  In Section
%\ref{sec:escapefraction} we find that the escape fraction increases in
%$20\%-30\%$ for the homogeneous source distribution. In the centrally
%located emission, the rotational effects are negligible on the escape
%fraction. 

%We also studied the effect of rotation in the position of the peaks in
%the line. We find that in the regions with central emission the peaks
%do not shift as rotation increases. However, in the homogeneous models
%the double peak merges into a single peak. 

Comparing our results with recent observed LAEs we find that many 
morphological features such as high central line flux, single peak
profiles and multi-peaked profiles could be explained by gas bulk 
rotation present in these LAEs.
